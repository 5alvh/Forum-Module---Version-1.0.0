# Forum Module - Version 1.0.1

## Overview
This is the initial release of the Forum Module for our application. The module allows users to interact through posts, comments, and likes. It also provides the foundational CRUD functionalities for user management and forum interactions. The data flow and design emphasize clean architecture, encapsulation, and adherence to best practices.

This release also includes a nearly finished like feature and addresses some bugs with the build plugins.

## Architecture
The module follows a layered architecture to separate concerns and ensure scalability.

### Layers:
1. **Models:** Represent the core entities in the system.
   - `User` (temporary, for testing purposes)
   - `Post`
   - `Comment`
   - `Like`

2. **DTOs (Data Transfer Objects):**
   - For each model, there are `CreateDTO`, `GetDTO`, and `UpdateDTO` classes.
   - Ensure only essential and non-sensitive information is transferred between layers.

3. **Mappers:**
   - Located in the `utils` package.
   - Convert models to DTOs and vice versa.
   - Prevent exposure of sensitive information.

4. **Repositories:**
   - CRUD operations for each model.
   - Acts as the data access layer.

5. **Services and Service Implementations:**
   - Encapsulate business logic.
   - Methods for handling user, post, and comment operations.
   - Modularized to allow seamless addition of future functionalities (e.g., likes).

6. **Controllers:**
   - REST APIs for interacting with the forum module.
   - User-friendly endpoints to manage users, posts, and comments.
   - Controllers for "likes" will be included in the next update.
